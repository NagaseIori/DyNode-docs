Thus, if you are familiar with Dynamaker&#39;s operations, you should be able to quickly get started with the basic operations of DyNode.</p><p>Below are the main operational differences between DyNode and Dynamaker.</p><ul><li>Notes can be moved directly by dragging with the mouse, in addition to double-click snapping. <ul><li>The movement of the beginning and end of a Hold is separate. If you want to move the entire Hold, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and then drag the beginning.</li><li>Currently, in multi-selection mode, Hold is forced to move as a whole.</li></ul></li><li>When placing notes, press and drag the left mouse button to change the note&#39;s width, release to place the note.</li><li>There are five editing modes, switchable with the number keys <kbd>1</kbd> ~ <kbd>5</kbd>. <ul><li>The first four modes are similar to Dynamaker, and the fifth mode is the preview (Playback) mode. This is also the default mode when entering the editor. In this mode, you can only preview the chart; all effects are enabled, and all editor effects are disabled. Therefore, after entering the editor, you need to select mode 4 to switch to edit (Edit) mode to edit the chart.</li></ul></li><li><kbd>C</kbd> / <kbd>V</kbd> will change the <strong>beatline</strong> density and subdivision method.</li><li>By default, the top left corner of a Note shows not the Note&#39;s Bar, but the time value of the Note (in milliseconds).</li><li>You can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> with drag to multi-select/deselect notes.</li><li>You can use <kbd>Ctrl + C/X/V/Z/Y</kbd> for copy/cut/paste/undo/redo operations.</li><li>You can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + mouse wheel for rapid note flow speed adjustment. If notes are selected at this time, you can make rapid bulk width adjustments.</li><li>You can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> / <kbd>V</kbd> to copy the width of a single note and bulk set the width of selected notes.</li><li>Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + ( <kbd>Shift</kbd> + ) arrow keys to fine-tune the position of selected notes.</li><li>Drag the right mouse button to quickly switch the editing side.</li></ul><p>Other basic operations/key positions are similar to Dynamaker.</p><h3 id="importing-charts-from-dynamaker" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#importing-charts-from-dynamaker" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Importing Charts from Dynamaker</h3><p>DyNode offers a way to directly import charts from Dynamaker.</p>',10),y=t("p",null,[t("img",{src:r,alt:"Create Project"})],-1),g=t("p",null,"If you already have a chart being edited in Dynamaker, you can directly import the Dynamaker chart in this project creation page.",-1),b=t("p",null,"The minimum files you need for this method include:",-1),k=t("li",null,"The chart's .xml/.dy file (exported from Dynamaker).

In this case, you should use the number keys <kbd>1</kbd> ~ <kbd>4</kbd> to switch to <strong>edit mode</strong> and use the <strong>arrow keys</strong> to display the beatlines. Similar to Dynamaker, you can use <kbd>Z/C</kbd> to switch beat snap divisor, but unlike Dynamaker, the display of beatlines changes with the beat snap divisor you use.</p><div class="hint-container info"><p class="hint-container-title">Tip</p><p>If you are in <strong>edit mode</strong> but the beatlines are not displayed, you can try to check:</p><ul><li>Did you choose to import chart related information?</li><li>Have you correctly configured BPM in Dynamaker-modified?</li><li>Did you add a music file?</li></ul></div><p>If you want to make additional calibration to the downbeat (or first beat) in the imported Timing Points, you can try using the shortcut <kbd>T</kbd>.
