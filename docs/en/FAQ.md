# Frequently Asked Questions

This page contains explanations for some common questions.

-----------
**Q:** Some features I want are missing / I encountered some problems / My game crashed / There are too many bugs...

**A:** Feel free to report these issues to the developer on Github or any other platform where the developer can be contacted!

-----------
**Q:** I pressed the left/right/down key, but no beatlines are showing, what's happening?

**A:** You might not have set up or correctly configured Timing Points. Or, you might not be in edit mode.

-----------
**Q:** Why is there no support for Windows 32-bit versions?

**A:** YoYoGames discontinued support for Windows x86 in their Gamemaker Runtime version 2022.8.

-----------
**Q:** My screen refresh rate is 144+ Hz, why is DyNode running at 60 FPS?

**A:** You might have G-SYNC or other VRR technologies enabled. After running DyNode once, you can edit the `config.json` in the program directory and change the FPS setting to your desired frame rate limit. See [Configuration](guide/configuration.html#fps) for more details.

-----------
**Q:** I want to turn off the auto-update prompt.

**A:** Edit `config.json` in the program directory and set the autoupdate option to 0. However, it is not recommended to do so as many problems with the testing-phase DyNode may not get timely fixes ðŸ˜”.
